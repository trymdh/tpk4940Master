This repository is a work in progress, and is a collection of code for my master thesis at NTNU about development and performance evaluation of a machine vision system for multi-pass robotic welding of large subsea structures.

The machine vision system is composed of an industrial line laser and an AT C4 highspeed CMOS camera that uses the GiGE-standard. Automation Technologies have provided me with their SDK and standalone Python (3.5.4) needed to configure and controll the camera via Python.
